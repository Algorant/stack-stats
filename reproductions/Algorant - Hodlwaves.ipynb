    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with Python and SQL. You can get the basics of it from the [Bitcoin Data Science] secitons on both, [here] and [here]. If you're completely unfamiliar, it'll take some time, but I promise it's worth it! Both are vital skills in order to understand whats going on.\n"
